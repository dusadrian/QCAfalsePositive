Description: Implements tests for Type I error in Qualitative Comparative
  Analysis (QCA) that take into account the multiple hypothesis tests inherent
  in the procedure. Tests can be carried out on three variants of QCA:
  crisp-set QCA (csQCA), multi-value QCA (mvQCA) and fuzzy-set QCA (fsQCA).
  For fsQCA, the fsQCApermTest() command implements a permutation test that
  provides 95% confidence intervals for the number of counterexamples and
  degree of consistency, respectively. The distributions of permuted values can
  be plotted against the observed values. For csQCA and mvQCA, simple binomial
  tests are implemented in csQCAbinTest() and mvQCAbinTest(), respectively.
